# ThreadPoolExecutor



线程过多会带来额外的开销，其中包括创建销毁线程的开销、调度线程的开销等等，同时也降低了计算机的整体性能。线程池维护多个线程，等待监督管理者分配可并发执行的任务。这种做法，一方面避免了处理任务时创建销毁线程开销的代价，另一方面避免了线程数量膨胀导致的过分调度问题，保证了对内核的充分利用



benefits：

- **降低资源消耗**：通过池化技术重复利用已创建的线程，降低线程创建和销毁造成的损耗。
- **提高响应速度**：任务到达时，无需等待线程创建即可立即执行。
- **提高线程的可管理性**：线程是稀缺资源，如果无限制创建，不仅会消耗系统资源，还会因为线程的不合理分布导致资源调度失衡，降低系统的稳定性。使用线程池可以进行统一的分配、调优和监控。
- **提供更多更强大的功能**：线程池具备可拓展性，允许开发人员向其中增加更多的功能。比如延时定时线程池ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor，就允许任务延期执行或定期执行。

### Executor

> An object that executes submitted **Runnable** tasks. This interface provides a way of decoupling task submission from the mechanics of how each task will be run, including details of thread use, scheduling, etc.

```java
public interface Executor {

    /**
     * Executes the given command at some time in the future.  The command
     * may execute in a new thread, in a pooled thread, or in the calling
     * thread, at the discretion of the {@code Executor} implementation.
     *
     * @param command the runnable task
     * @throws RejectedExecutionException if this task cannot be
     * accepted for execution
     * @throws NullPointerException if command is null
     */
    void execute(Runnable command);
}
```

### ExecutorService

> An Executor that provides methods to **manage termination** and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more **asynchronous tasks**.

```java
public interface ExecutorService extends Executor {

    void shutdown();

    List<Runnable> shutdownNow();

    boolean isShutdown();

    boolean isTerminated();

    boolean awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
        throws InterruptedException;

    <T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task);

    <T> Future<T> submit(Runnable task, T result);

    Future<?> submit(Runnable task);

    <T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks)
        throws InterruptedException;

    <T> List<Future<T>> invokeAll(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks,
                                  long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
        throws InterruptedException;

    <T> T invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks)
        throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException;

    <T> T invokeAny(Collection<? extends Callable<T>> tasks,
                    long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
        throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException;
}
```

### ScheduledExecutorService

> An ExecutorService that can **schedule** commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically.
> The schedule methods create tasks with various delays and return a task object that can be used to cancel or check execution. The **scheduleAtFixedRate** and **scheduleWithFixedDelay** methods create and execute tasks that run periodically until cancelled.

```java
public interface ScheduledExecutorService extends ExecutorService {

    public ScheduledFuture<?> schedule(Runnable command,
                                       long delay, TimeUnit unit);

    public <V> ScheduledFuture<V> schedule(Callable<V> callable,
                                           long delay, TimeUnit unit);

    public ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command,
                                                  long initialDelay,
                                                  long period,
                                                  TimeUnit unit);

    public ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command,
                                                     long initialDelay,
                                                     long delay,
                                                     TimeUnit unit);

}
```

#### ctl

>The main pool control state, ctl, is an atomic integer packing two conceptual fields workerCount, indicating the effective number of threads runState, indicating whether running, shutting down etc In order to pack them into one int, we limit workerCount to (2^29)-1 (about 500 million) threads rather than (2^31)-1 (2 billion) otherwise representable. If this is ever an issue in the future, the variable can be changed to be an AtomicLong, and the shift/mask constants below adjusted. But until the need arises, this code is a bit faster and simpler using an int. 
>
>The workerCount is the number of workers that have been permitted to start and not permitted to stop. The value may be transiently different from the actual number of live threads, for example when a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when asked, and when exiting threads are still performing bookkeeping before terminating. The user-visible pool size is reported as the current size of the workers set. 

```java
private final AtomicInteger ctl = new AtomicInteger(ctlOf(RUNNING, 0));
private static final int COUNT_BITS = Integer.SIZE - 3;
private static final int COUNT_MASK = (1 << COUNT_BITS) - 1;

// Packing and unpacking ctl
private static int runStateOf(int c)     { return c & ~COUNT_MASK; }
private static int workerCountOf(int c)  { return c & COUNT_MASK; }
private static int ctlOf(int rs, int wc) { return rs | wc; }

/*
 * Bit field accessors that don't require unpacking ctl.
 * These depend on the bit layout and on workerCount being never negative.
 */
private static boolean runStateLessThan(int c, int s) {
    return c < s;
}

private static boolean runStateAtLeast(int c, int s) {
    return c >= s;
}

private static boolean isRunning(int c) {
    return c < SHUTDOWN;
}
```




state


>The runState provides the main lifecycle control, taking on values: 
>
>RUNNING: Accept new tasks and process queued tasks 
>
>SHUTDOWN: Don't accept new tasks, but process queued tasks 
>
>STOP: Don't accept new tasks, don't process queued tasks, and interrupt in-progress tasks TIDYING: All tasks have terminated, workerCount is zero, 
>
>the thread transitioning to state TIDYING will run the terminated() hook method TERMINATED: terminated() has completed The numerical order among these values matters, to allow ordered comparisons. The runState monotonically increases over time, but need not hit each state. 
>
>The transitions are: RUNNING -> SHUTDOWN On invocation of shutdown(), perhaps implicitly in finalize() (RUNNING or SHUTDOWN) -> STOP On invocation of shutdownNow() SHUTDOWN -> TIDYING When both queue and pool are empty STOP -> TIDYING When pool is empty TIDYING -> TERMINATED 
>
>When the terminated() hook method has completed Threads waiting in awaitTermination() will return when the state reaches TERMINATED. 
>
>Detecting the transition from SHUTDOWN to TIDYING is less straightforward than you'd like because the queue may become empty after non-empty and vice versa during SHUTDOWN state, but we can only terminate if, after seeing that it is empty, we see that workerCount is 0 (which sometimes entails a recheck -- see below).

```java
// runState is stored in the high-order bits
private static final int RUNNING    = -1 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int SHUTDOWN   =  0 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int STOP       =  1 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int TIDYING    =  2 << COUNT_BITS;
private static final int TERMINATED =  3 << COUNT_BITS;
```

#### create

> Creates a new ThreadPoolExecutor with the given initial parameters.
> Params:
> corePoolSize – the number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle, unless allowCoreThreadTimeOut is set
> maximumPoolSize – the maximum number of threads to allow in the pool
> keepAliveTime – when the number of threads is greater than the core, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating.
> unit – the time unit for the keepAliveTime argument
> workQueue – the queue to use for holding tasks before they are executed. This queue will hold only the Runnable tasks submitted by the execute method.
> threadFactory – the factory to use when the executor creates a new thread
> handler – the handler to use when execution is blocked because the thread bounds and queue capacities are reached

```java
public ThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize,
                          int maximumPoolSize,
                          long keepAliveTime,
                          TimeUnit unit,
                          BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue,
                          ThreadFactory threadFactory,
                          RejectedExecutionHandler handler) {
    if (corePoolSize < 0 ||
        maximumPoolSize <= 0 ||
        maximumPoolSize < corePoolSize ||
        keepAliveTime < 0)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    if (workQueue == null || threadFactory == null || handler == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
    this.acc = System.getSecurityManager() == null ?
            null :
            AccessController.getContext();
    this.corePoolSize = corePoolSize;
    this.maximumPoolSize = maximumPoolSize;
    this.workQueue = workQueue;
    this.keepAliveTime = unit.toNanos(keepAliveTime);
    this.threadFactory = threadFactory;
    this.handler = handler;
}
```



#### BlockingQueue

阻塞队列(BlockingQueue)是一个支持两个附加操作的队列。这两个附加的操作是：在队列为空时，获取元素的线程会等待队列变为非空。当队列满时，存储元素的线程会等待队列可用。阻塞队列常用于生产者和消费者的场景，生产者是往队列里添加元素的线程，消费者是从队列里拿元素的线程。阻塞队列就是生产者存放元素的容器，而消费者也只从容器里拿元素。

| Blocking Queue Name   | Description      |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| ArrayBlockingQueue    | array FIFO       |
| LinkedBlockingQueue   | linked tableFIFO |
| PriorityBlockingQueue |                  |
| DelayQueue            |                  |
| SynchronousQueue      |                  |
| LinkedTransferQueue   | transfer method  |
| LinkedBlockingDeque   | Deque            |



#### execute

```java
/**
 * Executes the given task sometime in the future.  The task
 * may execute in a new thread or in an existing pooled thread.
 *
 * If the task cannot be submitted for execution, either because this
 * executor has been shutdown or because its capacity has been reached,
 * the task is handled by the current {@code RejectedExecutionHandler}.
 *
 * @param command the task to execute
 * @throws RejectedExecutionException at discretion of
 *         {@code RejectedExecutionHandler}, if the task
 *         cannot be accepted for execution
 * @throws NullPointerException if {@code command} is null
 */
public void execute(Runnable command) {
    if (command == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
    /*
     * Proceed in 3 steps:
     *
     * 1. If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, try to
     * start a new thread with the given command as its first

     * workerCount, and so prevents false alarms that would add
     * threads when it shouldn't, by returning false.
     *
     * 2. If a task can be successfully queued, then we still need
     * to double-check whether we should have added a thread
     * (because existing ones died since last checking) or that
     * the pool shut down since entry into this method. So we
     * recheck state and if necessary roll back the enqueuing if
     * stopped, or start a new thread if there are none.
     *
     * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
     * thread.  If it fails, we know we are shut down or saturated
     * and so reject the task.
     */
    int c = ctl.get();
    if (workerCountOf(c) < corePoolSize) {
        if (addWorker(command, true))
            return;
        c = ctl.get();
    }
    if (isRunning(c) && workQueue.offer(command)) {
        int recheck = ctl.get();
        if (! isRunning(recheck) && remove(command))
            reject(command);
        else if (workerCountOf(recheck) == 0)
            addWorker(null, false);
    }
    else if (!addWorker(command, false))
        reject(command);
}
```

1. 首先检测线程池运行状态，如果不是RUNNING，则直接拒绝，线程池要保证在RUNNING的状态下执行任务。
2. 如果workerCount < corePoolSize，则创建并启动一个线程来执行新提交的任务。
3. 如果workerCount >= corePoolSize，且线程池内的阻塞队列未满，则将任务添加到该阻塞队列中。
4. 如果workerCount >= corePoolSize && workerCount < maximumPoolSize，且线程池内的阻塞队列已满，则创建并启动一个线程来执行新提交的任务。
5. 如果workerCount >= maximumPoolSize，并且线程池内的阻塞队列已满, 则根据拒绝策略来处理该任务, 默认的处理方式是直接抛异常。

### Worker 

> Class Worker mainly maintains interrupt control state for threads running tasks, along with other minor bookkeeping. This class opportunistically extends **AbstractQueuedSynchronizer** to simplify acquiring and releasing a lock surrounding each task execution. This protects against interrupts that are intended to wake up a worker thread waiting for a task from instead interrupting a task being run. We implement a simple non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock rather than use ReentrantLock because we do not want worker tasks to be able to reacquire the lock when they invoke pool control methods like setCorePoolSize. Additionally, to suppress interrupts until the thread actually starts running tasks, we initialize lock state to a negative value, and clear it upon start (in runWorker).



线程池需要管理线程的生命周期，需要在线程长时间不运行的时候进行回收。线程池使用一张Hash表去持有线程的引用，这样可以通过添加引用、移除引用这样的操作来控制线程的生命周期。这个时候重要的就是如何判断线程是否在运行。

Worker是通过继承AQS，使用AQS来实现独占锁这个功能。没有使用可重入锁ReentrantLock，而是使用AQS，为的就是实现不可重入的特性去反应线程现在的执行状态。

1.lock方法一旦获取了独占锁，表示当前线程正在执行任务中。 2.如果正在执行任务，则不应该中断线程。 3.如果该线程现在不是独占锁的状态，也就是空闲的状态，说明它没有在处理任务，这时可以对该线程进行中断。 4.线程池在执行shutdown方法或tryTerminate方法时会调用interruptIdleWorkers方法来中断空闲的线程，interruptIdleWorkers方法会使用tryLock方法来判断线程池中的线程是否是空闲状态；如果线程是空闲状态则可以安全回收。



#### addWorker

```java
/**
 * Checks if a new worker can be added with respect to current
 * pool state and the given bound (either core or maximum). If so,
 * the worker count is adjusted accordingly, and, if possible, a
 * new worker is created and started, running firstTask as its
 * first task. This method returns false if the pool is stopped or
 * eligible to shut down. It also returns false if the thread
 * factory fails to create a thread when asked.  If the thread
 * creation fails, either due to the thread factory returning
 * null, or due to an exception (typically OutOfMemoryError in
 * Thread.start()), we roll back cleanly.
 *
 * @param firstTask the task the new thread should run first (or
 * null if none). Workers are created with an initial first task
 * (in method execute()) to bypass queuing when there are fewer
 * than corePoolSize threads (in which case we always start one),
 * or when the queue is full (in which case we must bypass queue).
 * Initially idle threads are usually created via
 * prestartCoreThread or to replace other dying workers.
 *
 * @param core if true use corePoolSize as bound, else
 * maximumPoolSize. (A boolean indicator is used here rather than a
 * value to ensure reads of fresh values after checking other pool
 * state).
 * @return true if successful
