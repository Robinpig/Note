## Introduction

Programming languages are notations for describing computations to people and to machines.
The world as we know it depends on programming languages, because all the software running on all the computers was written in some programming language.
But, before a program can be run, it first must be translated into a form in which it can be executed by a computer.

The software systems that do this translation are called *compilers*.
