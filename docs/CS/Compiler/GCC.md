## ELF


| ELF type           | Description | Examples        |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| Relocatable File   |             | .o, .obj        |
| Executable File    |             | /bin/bash, .exe |
| Shared Object File |             | .so, DLL        |
| Core Dump File     |             | core dump       |

use file

```shell
file /bin/ls
```

ELF is short for Executable and Linkable Format.
Itâ€™s a format used for storing binaries, libraries, and core dumps on disks in Linux and Unix-based systems.

The Executable and Linking Format was originally developed and published by UNIX System Laboratories (USL) as part of the Application Binary Interface (ABI).
The Tool Interface Standards committee(TIS) has selected the evolving ELF standard as a portable object file format that works on 32-bit Intel Architecture environments for a variety of operating systems.

The ELF standard is intended to streamline software development by providing developers with a set of binary interface definitions that extend across multiple operating environments.
This should reduce the number of different interface implementations, thereby reducing the need for recoding and recompiling code.

The ELF file is divided into two parts. The first part is the ELF header, while the second is the file data.

Further, the file data is made up of the Program header table, Section header table, and Data.

Particularly, the ELF header is always available in the ELF file, while the Section header table is important during link time to create an executable. On the other hand, the Program header table is useful during runtime to help load the executable into memory.
