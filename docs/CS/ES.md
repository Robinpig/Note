## Introduction

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/cn/elasticsearch) is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. 
As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

### KD Tree

The data-structure that underlies dimensional points is called a block KD tree,
which in the case of a single dimension is a simple binary search tree that stores blocks of values on the leaves rather than individual values.
Lucene currently defaults to having between 512 and 1024 values on the leaves.

This is quite similar to the b-trees that are used in most regular databases in order to index data.
In the case of Lucene, the fact that files are write-once makes the writing easy since we can build a perfectly balanced tree and then not worry about rebalancing since the tree will never be modified.
Merging is easy too since you can get a sorted iterator over the values that are stored in a segment,
then merge these iterators into a sorted iterator on the fly and build the tree of the merged segment from this sorted iterator.
