## Introduction

## Interpreter versus Compiler

By now, you might have understood that, any programming language is essentially a human-friendly formalism for writing instructions for a computer to follow.
These instructions are at some point translated into machine language, which is what the computer really understands.
Let’s introduce at this point some concepts of execution of programs written in high level programming languages.
As we have already seen, the only language that a computer can understand is the so called machine language.
These languages are composed of a set of basic operations whose execution is implemented in the hardware of the processor.

A Compiler and Interpreter both carry out the same purpose – convert a high level language (like C, Java) instructions into the binary form which is understandable by computer hardware.
However both compiler and interpreter have the same objective but they differ in the way they accomplish their task.

The programs created in high level languages can be executed by using two different ways.
The first one is the use of compiler and the other method is to use an interpreter.
High level instructionor language is converted into intermediate from by an interpreter.
The advantage of using an interpreter is that the high level instruction does not goes through compilation stage which can be a time consuming method.
So, by using an interpreter, the high level program is executed directly.
That is the reason why some programmers use interpreters while making small sections as this saves time.

Almost all high level programming languages have compilers and interpreters.
But some languages like LISP and BASIC are designed in such a way that the programs made using them are executed by an interpreter.

**Difference between compiler and interpreter**

- A complier converts the high level instruction into machine language while an interpreter converts the high level instruction into an intermediate form.
- Before execution, entire program is executed by the compiler whereas after translating the first line, an interpreter then executes it and so on.
- List of errors is created by the compiler after the compilation process while an interpreter stops translating after the first error.
- An independent executable file is created by the compiler whereas interpreter is required by an interpreted program each time.

## Script Languages

The term scripting language has never been formally defined, but here are the typical characteristics:

- Used often for system administration.
- Very casual with regard to typing of variables, e.g. no distinction between integer, floating-point or string variables.
- Lots of high-level operations intrinsic to the language, e.g. stack push/pop.
- Interpreted, rather than being compiled to the instruction set of the host machine.

Today many people prefer Python, as it is much cleaner and more elegant.
We look at three scripting languages: Shell, PERLand Python.
