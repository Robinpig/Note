## Introduction


Like stacks, queues are lists. With a queue, however, insertion is done at one end, whereas deletion is performed at the other end.

### Model
The basic operations on a queue are enqueue, which inserts an element at the end of the list (called the rear), 
and dequeue, which deletes (and returns) the element at the start of the list (known as the front). 

## Implementation

### Array

This is known as a *circular array* implementation.


## Applications

A whole branch of mathematics, known as queueing theory, deals with computing, probabilistically, how long users expect to wait on a line, how long the line gets, and other such questions. 
The answer depends on how frequently users arrive to the line and how long it takes to process a user once the user is served. 
Both of these parameters are given as probability distribution functions.
