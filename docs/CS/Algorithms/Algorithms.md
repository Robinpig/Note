## Introduction

中文的“算法”一词至少在唐代就出现了，在此之前也有“术”“算术”等词，最早出现在《周髀算经》《九章算术》。而且，“算法”一词的含义从古到今几乎没有发生变化。

英文的“算法”（algorithm）一词来源于 9 世纪波斯数学家花拉子米（al-Khwārizmī，780?~850?）——就是那个解决一次方程及一元二次方程的方法的人。花拉子米的拉丁文译名是“Algoritmi”。英文对“算法”原译为“algorism”，意思是花拉子米的运算法则，在 18 世纪演变为“algorithm”。这个词出现于 12 世纪，指的是用阿拉伯数字进行算术运算的过程

约公元前 300 年记载于《几何原本》中的辗转相除法（欧几里得算法）被人们认为是史上第一个算法，可以求两数的最大公约数

1936年 图灵提出《论数学计算在决断难题中之应用》 提出图灵机的概念 
图灵机的出现解决了算法定义的难题，图灵的思想对算法的发展起到了重要的作用

在此之后，算法更偏向于计算机科学领域，各种解决不同问题的算法也层出不穷，涉及排序、统计、线性规划、搜索、压缩等方面。

到了现在，随着人工智能和机器学习的发展，涉及到神经网络的算法变得越发重要





## Data Structures

数据结构是在计算机中存储和组织数据的一种特定方式，以便能够高效地使用这些数据
常见的数据结构类型包括数组、链表、栈、队列、树、图等。

根据元素的组织方式，数据结构可分为两类

1) 线性数据结构：元素按顺序访问，但不必将所有元素顺序存储 例如：链表、栈和队列
2) 非线性数据结构：此数据结构的元素以非线性顺序存储/访问 例如：树和图

An *abstract data type* (**ADT**) is a set of operations.
Abstract data types are mathematical abstractions; nowhere in an ADT's definition is there any mention of how the set of operations is implemented.
This can be viewed as an extension of modular design.

Commonly used ADTs include: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Binary Trees, Dictionaries, Disjoint Sets (Union and Find), Hash Tables, Graphs, and many others.
For example, stack uses a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) mechanism while storing the data in data structures.
The last element inserted into the stack is the first element that gets deleted.
Common operations are: creating the stack, pushing an element onto the stack, popping an element from the stack, finding the current top of the stack, finding the number of elements in the stack, etc.

While defining the ADTs do not worry about the implementation details.
They come into the picture only when we want to use them.
Different kinds of ADTs are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.
We will go through many of them and you will be in a position to relate the data structures to the kind of problems they solve.

### Lists, Stacks, and Queues

[Lists](/docs/CS/Algorithms/struct/list.md), [stacks](/docs/CS/Algorithms/struct/stack.md), and [queues](/docs/CS/Algorithms/struct/queue.md) are perhaps the three fundamental data structures in all of computer science.

[Arrays and Linked Lists](/docs/CS/Algorithms/struct/linked-list.md)


We introduce [hash tables](/docs/CS/Algorithms/hash.md), a widely used data structure supporting the dictionary operations INSERT, DELETE, and SEARCH.
In the worst case, hash tables require Θ(n) time to perform a SEARCH operation, but the expected time for hash-table operations is $O(1)$.
We rely on probability to analyze hash-table operations, but you can understand how the operations work even without probability.

### Tree

[Trees](/docs/CS/Algorithms/tree/tree.md) in general are very useful abstractions in computer science.

- [Trie](/docs/CS/Algorithms/tree/Trie.md)
- [Red-Black Tree](/docs/CS/Algorithms/tree/Red-Black-Tree.md)

> [!NOTE]

> **Definition**.
> A symbol table is a data structure for key-value pairs that supports two operations: insert (put) a new pair into the table and search for (get) the value associated with a given key.

## Algorithm Analysis

An *algorithm* is a finite set of instructions that, if followed, accomplishes a particular task.
In addition, all algorithms must satisfy the following criteria:

1. **Input**. There are zero or more quantities that are externally supplied.
2. **Output**. At least one quantity is produced.
3. **Definiteness**. Each instruction is clear and unambiguous.
4. **Finiteness**. If we trace out the instructions of an algorithm, then for all cases, the algorithm terminates after a finite number of steps.
5. **Effectiveness**. Every instruction must be basic enough to be carried out, in principle, by a person using only pencil and paper. 
   It is not enough that each operation be definite as in 3; it also must be feasible.

Computer algorithms solve computational problems.
We want two things from a computer algorithm: given an input to a problem, it should always produce a correct solution to the problem, and it should use computational resources efficiently while doing so. 
Let’s examine these two desiderata in turn.

For some problems, it might be difficult or even impossible to say whether an algorithm produces a correct solution.
Sometimes we can accept that a computer algorithm might produce an incorrect answer, as long as we can control how often it does so.
Correctness is a tricky issue with another class of algorithms, called *approximation algorithms*. 
Approximation algorithms apply to optimization problems, in which we want to find the best solution according to some quantitative measure.
Finding the fastest route, as a GPS does, is one example, where the quantitative measure is travel time.
For some problems, we have no algorithm that finds an optimal solution in any reasonable amount of time, but we know of an approximation algorithm that,
in a reasonable amount of time, can find a solution that is almost optimal. 

**What does it mean for an algorithm to use computational resources efficiently?** 

Indeed, time is the primary measure of efficiency that we use to evaluate an algorithm, once we have shown that the algorithm gives a correct solution.
But it is not the only measure.
We might be concerned with how much computer memory the algorithm requires (its “memory footprint”), since an algorithm has to run within the available memory.
Other possible resources that an algorithm might use: network communication, random bits (because algorithms that make random choices need a source of random numbers),
or disk operations (for algorithms that are designed to work with disk-resident data).”



### Complexity

Algorithms can be evaluated by a variety of criteria.
Most often we shall be interested in the rate of growth of the time or space required to solve larger and larger instances of a problem.
We would like to associate with a problem an integer. called the size of the problem, which is a measure of the quantity of input data.

The time needed by an algorithm expressed as a function of the size of a problem is called the *time complexity* of the algorithm.
The limiting behavior of the compiexity as size increases is called the *asymptotic time complexity*.
Analogous definitions can be made for *space complexity* and *asymptotic space complexity*.

The asymptotic complexity of an algorithm is an important measure of the goodness of an algorithm, one that promises to become even more important with future increases in computing speed.

Despite our concentration on order-of-magnitude performance, we should realize that an algorithm with a rapid growth rate might have a smaller constant of proportionality than one with a lower growth rate.
In that case. the rapidly growing algorithm might be superior for small problems. possibly even for all problems of a size that would interest us.

If for a given size the complexity is taken as the maximum complexity over all inputs of that size, then the complexity is called the *worst-case complexity*.
If the complexity is taken as the "average" complexity over all inputs of given size. then the complexity is called the *expected complexity*.
The expected complexity of an algorithm is usually more difficult to ascertain than the worst-case complexity.
One must make some assumption about the distribution of inputs, and realistic assumptions are often not mathematically tractable.
We shall emphasize the worst case, since it is more tractable and has a universal applicability.
However. it should be borne in mind that the algorithm with the best worst-case complexity does not necessarily have the best expected complexity.

In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input.
Big O notation, Big-omega notation and Big-theta notation are used to this end.


O-notation characterizes an upper bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function.
In other words, it says that a function grows no faster than a certain rate, based on the highest-order term.


> Knuth traces the origin of the O-notation to a number-theory text by P. Bachmann in 1892.
> The o-notation was invented b y E. Landau in b 1909 for his discussion of the distribution of prime numbers.
> The Ω and Θ notations were advocated bay Knuth to correct the popular, but technically sloppy, practice in the literature of using O-notation for both upper and lower bounds.

An abstract data type (ADT) is a data type that is organized in such a way that the specification of the objects and the specification of the operations on the objects is separated from the representation of the objects and the implementation of the operations.

> An algorithm is efficient if its running time is polynomial.



均摊时间复杂度，听起来跟平均时间复杂度有点儿像。对于初学者来说，这两个概念确实非常容易弄混。我前面说了，大部分情况下，我们并不需要区分最好、最坏、平均三种复杂度。平均复杂度只在某些特殊情况下才会用到，而均摊时间复杂度应用的场景比它更加特殊、更加有限



### Computation Model

Exact (not asymptotic) measures of efficiency can sometimes be computed but they usually require certain assumptions concerning the particular implementation of the algorithm, called model of computation.
A model of computation may be defined in terms of an abstract computer, e.g., Turing machine, and/or by postulating that certain operations are executed in unit time.

This model clearly has some weaknesses. Obviously, in real life, not all operations take exactly the same time.
In particular, in our model one disk read counts the same as an addition, even though the addition is typically several orders of magnitude faster.
Also, by assuming infinite memory, we never worry about page faulting, which can be a real



### Algorithm Types

将算法从问题到数据维度上归类 可以通过 体积(Volumn)、速度(Velocity) 和 多样性(Variety)





Euclid's algorithm is for computing the greatest common divisor.
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers is the largest integer that divides both.



**枚举算法（Enumeration Algorithm）**，又称穷举算法，是指根据问题的特点，逐一列出所有可能的解，并与目标条件进行比较，找出满足要求的答案。枚举时要确保不遗漏、不重复
由于需要遍历所有状态，枚举算法在问题规模较大时效率较低
因此，枚举算法常用于小规模问题，或作为其他算法的辅助工具，通过枚举部分信息来提升主算法的效率

### Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques

Text-editing programs frequently need to find all occurrences of a pattern in the text.
Typically, the text is a document being edited, and the pattern searched for is a particular word supplied by the user.
Efficient algorithms for this problem—called “[string matching](/docs/CS/Algorithms/string-search)”—can greatly aid the responsiveness of the text-editing program.

常见的算法优化技巧

[双指针](/docs/CS/Algorithms/Two-Pointers.md)

前缀和与差分是算法竞赛中常用的技巧，前者用于快速求区间和，后者用于高效进行区间修改


前缀和可以简单理解为「数列的前 n 项的和」，是一种重要的预处理方式
对于长度为 n 的序列 \{a_i\}，如果要多次查询区间 [l,r] 中序列数字的和，就可以考虑使用前缀和．序列的前缀和就是


𝑆𝑖=
𝑖
∑
𝑗=1

𝑎𝑗.

要询问区间 [𝑙,𝑟]
[l,r] 内的序列的和，只需要计算差值

𝑆([𝑙,𝑟])=𝑆𝑟−𝑆𝑙−1.

就这样，通过 𝑂(𝑛)
O(n) 时间预处理，能够将单次查询区间和的复杂度降低到 𝑂(1)
O(1)


差分是一种与前缀和相对的策略，是前缀和的逆运算．相较于给定某一序列求它的差分，竞赛中更为常见的情景是，通过维护差分序列的信息，实现多次区间修改．在区间修改结束后，可以通过前缀和恢复原序列的信息，实现对原序列的查询．注意修改操作一定要在查询操作之前

Gale–Shapley algorithm (also known as the Deferred Acceptance algorithm).
Gale Shapley Algorithm is an efficient algorithm that is used to solve the Stable Matching problem. 
It takes $O(N^2)$ time complexity where N is the number of people involved.

The subject called the [“NP-complete” problems](/docs/CS/Algorithms/NP.md), whose status is unknown.
No polynomial-time algorithm has yet been discovered for an NP-complete problem, nor has anyone yet been able to prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can exist for any one of them.
This so-called $P != NP$ question has been one of the deepest, most perplexing open research problems in theoretical computer science since it was first posed in 1971.
