A Byzantine fault (also Byzantine generals problem, interactive consistency, source congruency, error avalanche, Byzantine agreement problem, 
and Byzantine failure) is a condition of a computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, 
where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed.
The term takes its name from an allegory, the "Byzantine generals problem", developed to describe a situation in which, 
in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.
