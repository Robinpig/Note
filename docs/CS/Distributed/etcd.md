## Introduction

etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system, with a focus on being:

* *Simple*: well-defined, user-facing API (gRPC)
* *Secure*: automatic TLS with optional client cert authentication
* *Fast*: benchmarked 10,000 writes/sec
* *Reliable*: properly distributed using Raft

etcd is written in Go and uses the [Raft](/docs/CS/Distributed/Raft.md) consensus algorithm to manage a highly-available replicated log.
