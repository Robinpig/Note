## Introduction


[Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift) is a lightweight, language-independent software stack for point-to-point RPC implementation. 
Thrift provides clean abstractions and implementations for data transport, data serialization, and application level processing.
The code generation system takes a simple definition language as input and generates code across programming languages that uses the abstracted stack to build interoperable RPC clients and servers.
