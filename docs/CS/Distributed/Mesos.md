## Introduction

[Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org) is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel, only at a different level of abstraction. 
The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elasticsearch) with APIâ€™s for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.
