## Introduction

## Context Caching


Once the TestContext framework loads an ApplicationContext (or WebApplicationContext) for a test, that context is cached and reused for all subsequent tests that declare the same unique context configuration within the same test suite.
To understand how caching works, it is important to understand what is meant by “unique” and “test suite.”
