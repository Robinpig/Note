## Introduction



| Parameter     | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| initialSize   | 0            | The initial number of connections that are created when the pool is started. <br/>Since: 1.2                                                                                                       |
| maxTotal      | 8            | The maximum number of active connections that can be allocated from this pool at the same time, or negative for no limit.                                                                      |
| maxIdle       | 8            | The maximum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool, without extra ones being released, or negative for no limit.                                                               |
| minIdle       | 0            | The minimum number of connections that can remain idle in the pool, without extra ones being created, or zero to create none.                                                                  |
| maxWaitMillis | indefinitely | The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when there are no available connections) for a connection to be returned before throwing an exception, or -1 to wait indefinitely. |



NOTE: If maxIdle is set too low on heavily loaded systems it is possible you will see connections being closed and almost immediately new connections being opened.
This is a result of the active threads momentarily closing connections faster than they are opening them, causing the number of idle connections to rise above maxIdle.
The best value for maxIdle for heavily loaded system will vary but the default is a good starting point.

| validationQueryTimeout         | no timeout     | The timeout in seconds before connection validation queries fail. If set to a positive value, this value is passed to the driver via the`setQueryTimeout` method of the `Statement` used to execute the validation query.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

When minEvictableIdleTimeMillis is set to a positive value, minEvictableIdleTimeMillis is examined first by the idle connection evictor - i.e. when idle connections are visited by the evictor, idle time is first compared against minEvictableIdleTimeMillis (without considering the number of idle connections in the pool) and then against softMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis, including the minIdle constraint. |
| maxConnLifetimeMillis          | -1             | The maximum lifetime in milliseconds of a connection.

These statements are executed only once - when the configured connection factory creates the connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| lifo                           | true           | True means that borrowObject returns the most recently used ("last in") connection in the pool (if there are idle connections available). False means that the pool behaves as a FIFO queue - connections are taken from the idle instance pool in the order that they are returned to the pool.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
