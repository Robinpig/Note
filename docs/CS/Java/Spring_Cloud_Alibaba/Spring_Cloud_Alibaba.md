**Nacos: Dynamic *Na*ming and *Co*nfiguration *S*ervice**

### What does it do

Nacos (official site: [nacos.io](https://nacos.io)) is an easy-to-use platform designed for dynamic service discovery and configuration and service management. It helps you to build cloud native applications and microservices platform easily.

Service is a first-class citizen in Nacos. Nacos supports almost all type of services，for example，[Dubbo/gRPC service](https://nacos.io/en-us/docs/use-nacos-with-dubbo.html), [Spring Cloud RESTFul service](https://nacos.io/en-us/docs/use-nacos-with-springcloud.html) or [Kubernetes service](https://nacos.io/en-us/docs/use-nacos-with-kubernetes.html).

Nacos provides four major functions.

- **Service Discovery and Service Health Check**

  Nacos makes it simple for services to register themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface. Nacos also provides real-time health checks of services to prevent sending requests to unhealthy hosts or service instances.

- **Dynamic Configuration Management**

  Dynamic Configuration Service allows you to manage configurations of all services in a centralized and dynamic manner across all environments. Nacos eliminates the need to redeploy applications and services when configurations are updated, which makes configuration changes more efficient and agile.

- **Dynamic DNS Service**

  Nacos supports weighted routing, making it easier for you to implement mid-tier load balancing, flexible routing policies, flow control, and simple DNS resolution services in the production environment within your data center. It helps you to implement DNS-based service discovery easily and prevent applications from coupling to vendor-specific service discovery APIs.

- **Service and MetaData Management**

  Nacos provides an easy-to-use service dashboard to help you manage your services metadata, configuration, kubernetes DNS, service health and metrics statistics.
