## Introduction

[Resilience4j](https://resilience4j.readme.io/) is a lightweight fault tolerance library inspired by [Netflix Hystrix](/docs/CS/Java/Spring_Cloud/Hystrix.md), but designed for functional programming.

Resilience4j provides higher-order functions (decorators) to enhance any functional interface, lambda expression or method reference with a Circuit Breaker, Rate Limiter, Retry or Bulkhead.
