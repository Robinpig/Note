## Introduction

## JUnit5

**JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage**

The JUnit Platform serves as a foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM.
It also defines the TestEngine API for developing a testing framework that runs on the platform.
Furthermore, the platform provides a Console Launcher to launch the platform from the command line and the JUnit Platform Suite Engine for running a custom test suite using one or more test engines on the platform.
First-class support for the JUnit Platform also exists in popular IDEs (see IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, and Visual Studio Code) and build tools (see Gradle, Maven, and Ant).

JUnit Jupiter is the combination of the programming model and extension model for writing tests and extensions in JUnit 5.
The Jupiter sub-project provides a TestEngine for running Jupiter based tests on the platform.

JUnit Vintage provides a TestEngine for running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 based tests on the platform.
It requires JUnit 4.12 or later to be present on the class path or module path.
