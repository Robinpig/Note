## Introduction

Java Garbage Collection is the process by which Java programs perform [automatic memory management](/docs/CS/memory/GC.md).

The garbage collection implementation lives in the JVM. Each JVM can implement its own version of garbage collection. 
However, it should meet the standard JVM specification of working with the objects present in the heap memory, marking or identifying the unreachable objects, and destroying them with compaction.

## GC Algorithms

Recall the [gc algorithms](/docs/CS/memory/GC.md?id=Tracing-garbage-collection), the JVM using tracing.

**What are Garbage Collection Roots in Java?**

Garbage collectors work on the concept of Garbage Collection Roots (GC Roots) to identify live and dead objects.
Examples of such Garbage Collection roots are:

- Classes loaded by system class loader (not custom class loaders) `ClassLoaderDataGraph::roots_cld_do`
- Live threads `Threads::possibly_parallel_oops_do`
- Local variables and parameters of the currently executing methods
- Local variables and parameters of JNI methods
- Global JNI reference `JNIHandles::oops_do`
- Objects used as a monitor for synchronization
- Objects held from garbage collection by JVM for its purposes
- CodeCache `CodeCache::blobs_do`

The garbage collector traverses the whole object graph in memory, starting from those Garbage Collection Roots and following references from the roots to other objects.


JDK 10中的JEP 304: Garbage Collector Interface发布后，GC代码可读性提升很多。

## Generation

Generational garbage collectors need to keep track of references from older to younger generations so that younger generations can be garbage-collected without inspecting every object in the older generation(s).
The set of locations potentially containing pointers to newer objects is often called the `remembered set`.

At every store, the system must ensure that the updated location is added to the `remembered set` if the store creates a reference from an older to a newer object.
This mechanism is usually referred to as a `write barrier` or `store check`.

2. Two-Instruction



See [G1 Roots](/docs/CS/Java/JDK/JVM/G1.md?id=roots)

Tri-color Marking

interceptor and JIT use Write Barrier to maintain Card Table

### mark

- at oop like serial
- bitMap out of object like G1 Shenandoah
- Colored Pointer like ZGC

### Young Generation

Newly created objects start in the Young Generation. The Young Generation is further subdivided into:

- Eden space - all new objects start here, and initial memory is allocated to them
- Survivor spaces (FromSpace and ToSpace) - objects are moved here from Eden after surviving one garbage collection cycle.

When objects are garbage collected from the Young Generation, it is a `minor garbage collection` event.

When Eden space is filled with objects, a Minor GC is performed.
All the dead objects are deleted, and all the live objects are moved to one of the survivor spaces.
Minor GC also checks the objects in a survivor space, and moves them to the other survivor space.

Take the following sequence as an example:

- Eden has all objects (live and dead)
- Minor GC occurs - all dead objects are removed from Eden. All live objects are moved to S1 (FromSpace). Eden and S2 are now empty.
- New objects are created and added to Eden. Some objects in Eden and S1 become dead.
- Minor GC occurs - all dead objects are removed from Eden and S1. All live objects are moved to S2 (ToSpace). Eden and S1 are now empty.

So, at any time, one of the survivor spaces is always empty. When the surviving objects reach a certain threshold of moving around the survivor spaces, they are moved to the Old Generation.

You can use the `-Xmn` flag to set the size of the Young Generation.

default old/young=2:1

Eden:from:to=8:1:1

#### Handle Promotion

当HandlePromotionFailure设置true 允许
否则进行Full GC



### Old Generation

Objects that are long-lived are eventually moved from the Young Generation to the Old Generation.
This is also known as Tenured Generation, and contains objects that have remained in the survivor spaces for a long time.

When objects are garbage collected from the Old Generation, it is a `major garbage collection` event.

You can use the -Xms and -Xmx flags to set the size of the initial and maximum size of the Heap memory.

### Intergenerational Reference Hypothesis

Remembered Set

- bits
- objects
- Card Table

False Sharing

```
  product(bool, UseCondCardMark, false,                                     \
          "Check for already marked card before updating card table")       \
```

## MetaSpace

Starting with Java 8, the MetaSpace memory space replaces the PermGen space. 
The implementation differs from the PermGen and this space of the heap is now automatically resized.

This avoids the problem of applications running out of memory due to the limited size of the PermGen space of the heap. 
The Metaspace memory can be garbage collected and the classes that are no longer used can be automatically cleaned when the Metaspace reaches its maximum size.

```


## allocate

对于 HotSpot JVM 实现，所有的 GC 算法的实现都是一种对于堆内存的管理，也就是都实现了一种堆的抽象，它们都实现了接口 CollectedHeap


### TLAB



当前 TLAB 不够分配时，如果剩余空间小于**最大浪费空间限制**，那么这个 TLAB 会被退回 Eden，重新申请一个新的。这个剩余空间就会成为孔隙

如果不管这些孔隙，由于 TLAB 仅线程内知道哪些被分配了，在 GC 扫描发生时返回 Eden 区，如果不填充的话，外部并不知道哪一部分被使用哪一部分没有，需要做额外的检查，那么会影响 GC 扫描效率。所以 TLAB 回归 Eden 的时候，**会将剩余可用的空间用一个 dummy object 填充满**。如果填充**已经确认会被回收的对象**，也就是 dummy object， GC 会直接标记之后跳过这块内存，增加扫描效率。但是同时，由于需要填充这个 dummy object，所以需要**预留出这个对象的对象头的空间**


```c
// ThreadLocalAllocBuffer.hpp
class ThreadLocalAllocBuffer: public CHeapObj<mtThread> {
  friend class VMStructs;
  friend class JVMCIVMStructs;
private:
  HeapWord* _start;                              // address of TLAB
  HeapWord* _top;                                // address after last allocation
  HeapWord* _pf_top;                             // allocation prefetch watermark
  HeapWord* _end;                                // allocation end (can be the sampling end point or _allocation_end)
  HeapWord* _allocation_end;                     // end for allocations (actual TLAB end, excluding alignment_reserve)

  size_t    _desired_size;                       // desired size   (including alignment_reserve)
  size_t    _refill_waste_limit;                 // hold onto tlab if free() is larger than this
  size_t    _allocated_before_last_gc;           // total bytes allocated up until the last gc
  size_t    _bytes_since_last_sample_point;      // bytes since last sample point.

  static size_t   _max_size;                          // maximum size of any TLAB
  static int      _reserve_for_allocation_prefetch;   // Reserve at the end of the TLAB
  static unsigned _target_refills;                    // expected number of refills between GCs

  unsigned  _number_of_refills;
  unsigned  _refill_waste;
  unsigned  _gc_waste;
  unsigned  _slow_allocations;
  size_t    _allocated_size;

  AdaptiveWeightedAverage _allocation_fraction;  // fraction of eden allocated in tlabs
};
```
JVM启动[universe_init]()时会初始化全局的TLAB

```c
void Universe::initialize_tlab() {
  ThreadLocalAllocBuffer::set_max_size(Universe::heap()->max_tlab_size());
  PLAB::startup_initialization();
  if (UseTLAB) {
    ThreadLocalAllocBuffer::startup_initialization();
  }
}
```

```c
void ThreadLocalAllocBuffer::startup_initialization() {
  ThreadLocalAllocStats::initialize();

  // Assuming each thread's active tlab is, on average,
  // 1/2 full at a GC
  _target_refills = 100 / (2 * TLABWasteTargetPercent);
  // We need to set initial target refills to 2 to avoid a GC which causes VM
  // abort during VM initialization.
  _target_refills = MAX2(_target_refills, 2U);

#ifdef COMPILER2
  // If the C2 compiler is present, extra space is needed at the end of
  // TLABs, otherwise prefetching instructions generated by the C2
  // compiler will fault (due to accessing memory outside of heap).
  // The amount of space is the max of the number of lines to
  // prefetch for array and for instance allocations. (Extra space must be
  // reserved to accommodate both types of allocations.)
  //
  // Only SPARC-specific BIS instructions are known to fault. (Those
  // instructions are generated if AllocatePrefetchStyle==3 and
  // AllocatePrefetchInstr==1). To be on the safe side, however,
  // extra space is reserved for all combinations of
  // AllocatePrefetchStyle and AllocatePrefetchInstr.
  //
  // If the C2 compiler is not present, no space is reserved.

  // +1 for rounding up to next cache line, +1 to be safe
  if (CompilerConfig::is_c2_or_jvmci_compiler_enabled()) {
    int lines =  MAX2(AllocatePrefetchLines, AllocateInstancePrefetchLines) + 2;
    _reserve_for_allocation_prefetch = (AllocatePrefetchDistance + AllocatePrefetchStepSize * lines) /
                                       (int)HeapWordSize;
  }
#endif

  // During jvm startup, the main thread is initialized
  // before the heap is initialized.  So reinitialize it now.
  guarantee(Thread::current()->is_Java_thread(), "tlab initialization thread not Java thread");
  Thread::current()->tlab().initialize();
}
```
每个[JavaThread::run](/docs/CS/Java/JDK/Concurrency/Thread.md?id=JavaThreadrun)时会先分配TLAB

```c
// thread.cpp
void Thread::initialize_tlab() {
  if (UseTLAB) {
    tlab().initialize();
  }
}
```

```c
void ThreadLocalAllocBuffer::initialize() {
  initialize(nullptr,                    // start
             nullptr,                    // top
             nullptr);                   // end

  set_desired_size(initial_desired_size());

  size_t capacity = Universe::heap()->tlab_capacity(thread()) / HeapWordSize;
  if (capacity > 0) {
    // Keep alloc_frac as float and not double to avoid the double to float conversion
    float alloc_frac = desired_size() * target_refills() / (float)capacity;
    _allocation_fraction.sample(alloc_frac);
  }

  set_refill_waste_limit(initial_refill_waste_limit());

  reset_statistics();
}
```
计算初识期望大小
```c
size_t ThreadLocalAllocBuffer::initial_desired_size() {
  size_t init_sz = 0;

  if (TLABSize > 0) {
    init_sz = TLABSize / HeapWordSize;
  } else {
    // Initial size is a function of the average number of allocating threads.
    unsigned int nof_threads = ThreadLocalAllocStats::allocating_threads_avg();

    init_sz  = (Universe::heap()->tlab_capacity(thread()) / HeapWordSize) /
                      (nof_threads * target_refills());
    init_sz = align_object_size(init_sz);
  }
  // We can't use clamp() between min_size() and max_size() here because some
  // options based on them may still be inconsistent and so it may assert;
  // inconsistencies between those will be caught by following AfterMemoryInit
  // constraint checking.
  init_sz = MIN2(MAX2(init_sz, min_size()), max_size());
  return init_sz;
}
```


TLAB 外的分配策略，不同的 GC 算法不同


## Young GC 问题


If it takes long time, check the size
```
-XX:+UsePSAdaptiveSurvivorSizePolicy

-XX:SurvivorRatio

```

Card Table

write barrier

```
CARD_TABLE [this address >> 9] = DIRTY;
```

-XX:+UseCondCardMark



-XX:+PrintReferenceGC

#### YGC耗时异常

- toot对象扫描+标记时间过长
- 存活对象copy耗时较大
- 等待各线程到达安全点时间较长
- GC日志对GC时间的影响

```cpp

// Used only for markSweep, scavenging
bool oopDesc::is_gc_marked() const {
  return mark_raw()->is_marked();
}


// Used by scavengers
bool oopDesc::is_forwarded() const {
  // The extra heap check is needed since the obj might be locked, in which case the
  // mark would point to a stack location and have the sentinel bit cleared
  return mark_raw()->is_marked();
}



// Used by scavengers
void oopDesc::forward_to(oop p) {
  markOop m = markOopDesc::encode_pointer_as_mark(p);
  set_mark_raw(m);
}
```


### System.gc

```java
public final class System {
   public static void gc() {
        Runtime.getRuntime().gc();
    }
}

public class Runtime {
 		public native void gc();
}
```

Differenct heap will execute `collect` method if `!DisableExplicitGC`.

- Some collectors will execute concurrentFullGC if `-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent`

```cpp
// Runtime.c
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_java_lang_Runtime_gc(JNIEnv *env, jobject this)
{
    JVM_GC();
}

// jvm.cpp
JVM_ENTRY_NO_ENV(void, JVM_GC(void))
  if (!DisableExplicitGC) {
    EventSystemGC event;
    event.set_invokedConcurrent(ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent);
    Universe::heap()->collect(GCCause::_java_lang_system_gc);
    event.commit();
  }
JVM_END
```







## Collectors

Following Dijkstra *et al*, a garbage-collected program is divided into two semiindependent parts.

- The mutator executes application code, which allocates new objects and mutates the object graph by changing reference fields so that they refer to different destination objects.
  These reference fields may be contained in heap objects as well as other places known as roots, such as static variables, thread stacks, and so on.
  As a result of such reference updates, any object can end up disconnected from the roots, that is, unreachable by following any sequence of edges from the roots.
- The collector executes garbage collection code, which discovers unreachable objects and reclaims their storage.

A program may have more than one mutator thread, but the threads together can usually be thought of as a single actor over the heap. 
Equally, there may be one or more collector threads.

[JEP 312: Thread-Local Handshakes](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/312)

### Epsilon

Epsilon is a do-nothing (no-op) garbage collector that was released as part of JDK 11( see [JEP 318: Epsilon: A No-Op Garbage Collector](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/318)).
It handles memory allocation but does not implement any actual memory reclamation mechanism.
Once the available Java heap is exhausted, the JVM shuts down.

### Serial

The serial collector uses a single thread to perform all garbage collection work, which makes it relatively efficient because there is no communication overhead between threads.

It's best-suited to single processor machines because it can't take advantage of multiprocessor hardware, although it can be useful on multiprocessors for applications with small data sets (up to approximately 100 MB).
The serial collector is selected by default on certain hardware and operating system configurations, or can be explicitly enabled with the option `-XX:+UseSerialGC`.

Cheney algorithm

Moon algorithm

#### Serial Old

- with Parallel JDK5
- CMS Concurrent Mode Failure

### Parallel Scavenge

The parallel collector is also known as throughput collector, it's a generational collector similar to the serial collector.
The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple threads that are used to speed up garbage collection.

The parallel collector is intended for applications with medium-sized to large-sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor or multithreaded hardware.
You can enable it by using the `-XX:+UseParallelGC` option.

Parallel Scavenge and Parallel Old

```
- GCTimeRatio                               = 99
- MaxGCPauseMillis                          = 18446744073709551615


- UseParallelGC                            := true
- UseParallelOldGC                          = true
- UseAdaptiveGCBoundary                     = false
```

see [Garbage Collector Ergonomics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/gc-ergonomics.html)

### Concurrent

The mostly concurrent collector trades processor resources (which would otherwise be available to the application) for shorter major collection pause times. The most visible overhead is the use of one or more processors during the concurrent parts of the collection. On an N processor system, the concurrent part of the collection will use K/N of the available processors, where 1<=K<=ceiling{N/4}. (Note that the precise choice of and bounds on K are subject to change.) In addition to the use of processors during concurrent phases, additional overhead is incurred to enable concurrency. Thus while garbage collection pauses are typically much shorter with the concurrent collector, application throughput also tends to be slightly lower than with the other collectors.

On a machine with more than one processing core, processors are available for application threads during the concurrent part of the collection, so the concurrent garbage collector thread does not "pause" the application. This usually results in shorter pauses, but again fewer processor resources are available to the application and some slowdown should be expected, especially if the application uses all of the processing cores maximally. As N increases, the reduction in processor resources due to concurrent garbage collection becomes smaller, and the benefit from concurrent collection increases. The section Concurrent Mode Failure in Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector discusses potential limits to such scaling.

Because at least one processor is used for garbage collection during the concurrent phases, the concurrent collectors do not normally provide any benefit on a uniprocessor (single-core) machine. However, there is a separate mode available for CMS (not G1) that can achieve low pauses on systems with only one or two processors; see Incremental Mode in Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector for details. This feature is being deprecated in Java SE 8 and may be removed in a later major release.

### CMS

[JEP 291: Deprecate the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/291)

### G1

[G1GC](/docs/CS/Java/JDK/JVM/G1.md) was intended as a replacement for CMS and was designed for multi-threaded applications that have a large heap size available (more than 4GB). 
It is parallel and concurrent like CMS, but it works quite differently under the hood compared to the older garbage collectors.


### Shenandoah

Shenandoah is a new GC that was released as part of JDK 12.
Shenandoah’s key advantage over G1 is that it does more of its garbage collection cycle work concurrently with the application threads.
G1 can evacuate its heap regions only when the application is paused, while Shenandoah can relocate objects concurrently with the application.

Shenandoah can compact live objects, clean garbage, and release RAM back to the OS almost immediately after detecting free memory.
Since all of this happens concurrently while the application is running, Shenandoah is more CPU intensive.

The JVM argument to use the Epsilon Garbage Collector is `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseShenandoahGC`.

[JEP 189: Shenandoah: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Experimental)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/189)

**Connection Matrix** for InterRegional Reference Hypothesis

### ZGC

[JEP 333: ZGC: A Scalable Low-Latency Garbage Collector (Experimental)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/333)

The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is a scalable low latency garbage collector. ZGC performs all expensive work concurrently, without stopping the execution of application threads.

ZGC is intended for applications which require low latency (less than 10 ms pauses) and/or use a very large heap (multi-terabytes). You can enable is by using the -XX:+UseZGC option.

ZGC is available as an experimental feature, starting with JDK 11 and has been improved in JDK 12. It is intended for applications which require low latency (less than 10 ms pauses) and/or use a very large heap (multi-terabytes).

The primary goals of ZGC are low latency, scalability, and ease of use. To achieve this, ZGC allows a Java application to continue running while it performs all garbage collection operations. By default, ZGC uncommits unused memory and returns it to the operating system.

The JVM argument to use the Epsilon Garbage Collector is `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseZGC`.

### How to Select the Right Garbage Collector


Most of the time, the default settings should work just fine.
If necessary, you can adjust the heap size to improve performance. 
If the performance still doesn't meet your goals, you can modify the collector as per your application requirements:

- Serial - If the application has a small data set (up to approximately 100 MB) and/or it will be run on a single processor with no pause-time requirements
- Parallel - If peak application performance is the priority and there are no pause-time requirements or pauses of one second or longer are acceptable
- CMS/G1 - If response time is more important than overall throughput and garbage collection pauses must be kept shorter than approximately one second
- ZGC - If response time is a high priority, and/or you are using a very large heap

### Collector tuning

Parameters:

- ParallelGCThreads
- ConcGCThreads

UseAdaptiveSizePolicy

MaxGCPauseMillis

GCTimeRatio

- MaxHeapSize/Xmx
- MinHeapSize/Xms
- NewSize/Xmn

- TLABSize
- YoungPLABSize/OldOLABSize

The JVM can be blocked for substantial time periods when disk IO is heavy.
JVM GC needs to log GC activities by issuing write() system calls;
Such write() calls can be blocked due to background disk IO;
GC logging is on the JVM pausing path, hence the time taken by write() calls contribute to JVM STW pauses.

For latency-sensitive applications, an immediate solution should be avoiding the IO contention by putting the GC log file on a separate HDD or high-performing disk such as SSD.


## memory leak

内存泄漏是指无用对象（不再使用的对象）持续占有内存或无用对象的内存得不到及时释放，从而造成内存空间的浪费称为内存泄漏
内存泄露有时不严重且不易察觉，这样开发者就不知道存在内存泄露，需要自主观察，比较严重的时候，没有内存可以分配，直接oom


常见的内存泄露

Metaspace

如果一个应用加载了大量的class, 那么Perm区存储的信息一般会比较大.另外大量的intern String对象也会导致该区不断增长。

比较常见的一个是Groovy动态编译class造成泄露

Heap



静态集合类引起内存泄露

监听器：但往往在释放对象的时候却没有记住去删除这些监听器，从而增加了内存泄漏的机会。

各种连接，数据库、网络、IO等

内部类和外部模块等的引用：内部类的引用是比较容易遗忘的一种，而且一旦没释放可能导致一系列的后继类对象没有释放。非静态内部类的对象会隐式强引用其外围对象，所以在内部类未释放时，外围对象也不会被释放，从而造成内存泄漏











## Tuning

年轻代的内存使用率处在高位，导致频繁的 Minor GC，而频繁 GC 的效率又不高，说明对象没那么快能被回收，这时年轻代可以适当调大一点

年老代的内存使用率处在高位，导致频繁的 Full GC，这样分两种情况：
- 如果每次 Full GC 后年老代的内存占用率没有下来，可以怀疑是内存泄漏；
- 如果 Full GC 后年老代的内存占用率下来了，说明不是内存泄漏，我们要考虑调大年老代


### OOM

- heap
- GC overhead 考虑内存泄漏
- Requested array size exceeds VM limit 大数组分配
- MetaSpace
- Request size bytes for reason. Out of swap space
- Unable to create native threads
