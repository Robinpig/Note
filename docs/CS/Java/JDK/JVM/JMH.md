## Introduction

One of the positive aspects of working with microbenchmarks is that it exposes the highly dynamic behavior and non-normal distributions that are produced by low-level subsystems. 
This, in turn, leads to a better understanding and mental models of the complexities of the JVM.


- Do not microbenchmark unless you know you are a known use case for it.
- If you must microbenchmark, use JMH.
- Discuss your results as publicly as you can, and in the company of your peers.
- Be prepared to be wrong a lot and to have your thinking challenged repeatedly.
