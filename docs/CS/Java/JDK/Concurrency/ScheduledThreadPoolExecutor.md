## ScheduledExecutorService

```java
/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that can schedule commands to run after a given
 * delay, or to execute periodically.
 *
 * <p>The {@code schedule} methods create tasks with various delays
 * and return a task object that can be used to cancel or check
 * execution. The {@code scheduleAtFixedRate} and
 * {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay} methods create and execute tasks
 * that run periodically until cancelled.
 *
 * <p>Commands submitted using the {@link Executor#execute(Runnable)}
 * and {@link ExecutorService} {@code submit} methods are scheduled
 * with a requested delay of zero. Zero and negative delays (but not
 * periods) are also allowed in {@code schedule} methods, and are
 * treated as requests for immediate execution.
 *
 * <p>All {@code schedule} methods accept <em>relative</em> delays and
 * periods as arguments, not absolute times or dates. It is a simple
 * matter to transform an absolute time represented as a {@link
 * java.util.Date} to the required form. For example, to schedule at
 * a certain future {@code date}, you can use: {@code schedule(task,
 * date.getTime() - System.currentTimeMillis(),
 * TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)}. Beware however that expiration of a
 * relative delay need not coincide with the current {@code Date} at
 * which the task is enabled due to network time synchronization
 * protocols, clock drift, or other factors.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class provides convenient factory methods for
 * the ScheduledExecutorService implementations provided in this package.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example</h3>
 *
 * Here is a class with a method that sets up a ScheduledExecutorService
 * to beep every ten seconds for an hour:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * import static java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.*;
 * class BeeperControl {
 *   private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
 *     Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
 *
 *   public void beepForAnHour() {
 *     final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() { System.out.println("beep"); }
 *     };
 *     final ScheduledFuture<?> beeperHandle =
 *       scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
 *     scheduler.schedule(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() { beeperHandle.cancel(true); }
 *     }, 60 * 60, SECONDS);
 *   }
 * }}</pre>

## ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor

  *This class specializes ThreadPoolExecutor implementation by*

    1. *Using a custom task type, ScheduledFutureTask for tasks, even those that don't require scheduling (i.e., those submitted using ExecutorService execute, not ScheduledExecutorService methods) which are treated as delayed tasks with a delay of zero.*
    2. *Using a custom queue (DelayedWorkQueue), a variant of unbounded DelayQueue. The lack of capacity constraint and the fact that corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize are effectively identical simplifies some execution mechanics (see delayedExecute) compared to ThreadPoolExecutor.*
    3. *Supporting optional run-after-shutdown parameters, which leads to overrides of shutdown methods to remove and cancel tasks that should NOT be run after shutdown, as well as different recheck logic when task (re)submission overlaps with a shutdown.*
    4. *Task decoration methods to allow interception and instrumentation, which are needed because subclasses cannot otherwise override submit methods to get this effect. These don't have any impact on pool control logic though.*





```java
public void run() {
    if (!canRunInCurrentRunState(this))
        cancel(false);
    else if (!isPeriodic())
        super.run();
    else if (super.runAndReset()) {
        setNextRunTime();
        reExecutePeriodic(outerTask);
    }
}
```



### compareTo

```java
public int compareTo(Delayed other) {
    if (other == this) // compare zero if same object
        return 0;
    if (other instanceof ScheduledFutureTask) {
        ScheduledFutureTask<?> x = (ScheduledFutureTask<?>)other;
        long diff = time - x.time;
        if (diff < 0)
            return -1;
        else if (diff > 0)
            return 1;
        else if (sequenceNumber < x.sequenceNumber)
            return -1;
        else
            return 1;
    }
    long diff = getDelay(NANOSECONDS) - other.getDelay(NANOSECONDS);
    return (diff < 0) ? -1 : (diff > 0) ? 1 : 0;
}
```



## scheduleAtFixedRate

```java
public ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command,
                                              long initialDelay,
                                              long period,
                                              TimeUnit unit) {
    if (command == null || unit == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
    if (period <= 0L)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    ScheduledFutureTask<Void> sft =
        new ScheduledFutureTask<Void>(command,
                                      null,
                                      triggerTime(initialDelay, unit),
                                      unit.toNanos(period),
                                      sequencer.getAndIncrement());
    RunnableScheduledFuture<Void> t = decorateTask(command, sft);
    sft.outerTask = t;
    delayedExecute(t);
    return t;
}
```



## scheduleWithFixedDelay

```java
public ScheduledFuture<?> scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command,
                                                 long initialDelay,
                                                 long delay,
                                                 TimeUnit unit) {
    if (command == null || unit == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
    if (delay <= 0L)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    ScheduledFutureTask<Void> sft =
        new ScheduledFutureTask<Void>(command,
                                      null,
                                      triggerTime(initialDelay, unit),
                                      -unit.toNanos(delay),
                                      sequencer.getAndIncrement());
    RunnableScheduledFuture<Void> t = decorateTask(command, sft);
    sft.outerTask = t;
    delayedExecute(t);
    return t;
}
```





```java
private void delayedExecute(RunnableScheduledFuture<?> task) {
    if (isShutdown())
        reject(task);
    else {
        super.getQueue().add(task);
        if (!canRunInCurrentRunState(task) && remove(task))
            task.cancel(false);
        else
            ensurePrestart();
    }
}
```



Same as prestartCoreThread except arranges that at least one thread is started even if corePoolSize is 0.

```java
void ensurePrestart() {
    int wc = workerCountOf(ctl.get());
    if (wc < corePoolSize)
        addWorker(null, true);
    else if (wc == 0)
        addWorker(null, false);
}
```



## DelayedWorkQueue

Specialized delay queue. To mesh with TPE declarations, this class must be declared as a BlockingQueue  even though it can only hold RunnableScheduledFutures.

```java
static class DelayedWorkQueue extends AbstractQueue<Runnable>
    implements BlockingQueue<Runnable> {}
```



### take

```java
public RunnableScheduledFuture<?> take() throws InterruptedException {
    final ReentrantLock lock = this.lock;
    lock.lockInterruptibly();
    try {
        for (;;) {
            RunnableScheduledFuture<?> first = queue[0];
            if (first == null)
                available.await();
            else {
                long delay = first.getDelay(NANOSECONDS);
                if (delay <= 0L)
                    return finishPoll(first);
                first = null; // don't retain ref while waiting
                if (leader != null)
                    available.await();
                else {
                    Thread thisThread = Thread.currentThread();
                    leader = thisThread;
                    try {
                        available.awaitNanos(delay);
                    } finally {
                        if (leader == thisThread)
                            leader = null;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    } finally {
        if (leader == null && queue[0] != null)
            available.signal();
        lock.unlock();
    }
}
```



### offer

```java
public boolean offer(Runnable x) {
    if (x == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
    RunnableScheduledFuture<?> e = (RunnableScheduledFuture<?>)x;
    final ReentrantLock lock = this.lock;
    lock.lock();
    try {
        int i = size;
        if (i >= queue.length)
            grow();
        size = i + 1;
        if (i == 0) {
            queue[0] = e;
            setIndex(e, 0);
        } else {
            siftUp(i, e);
        }
        if (queue[0] == e) {
            leader = null;
            available.signal();
        }
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
    return true;
}
```
