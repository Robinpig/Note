# Future

*We could create a **Thread** object with a **Runnable** target, also use **FutureTask** to get **Future**.*

### Runnable

*The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be **executed by a thread**. The class must define a method of no arguments **called run**.*
*This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that wish to execute code while they are active. **Runnable is implemented by class Thread.***

*A class that implements Runnable can run without subclassing Thread by instantiating a Thread instance and passing itself in as the target.his is important because classes should not be subclassed unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental behavior of the class.*

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Runnable {

    public abstract void run();
}
```



### Callable

*A task that **returns a result and may throw an exception**. Implementors define a single method with no arguments **called call**.*

**Runnable does not return a result and cannot throw a checked exception.**

**The Callable interface is similar to Runnable**, in that both are designed for classes whose instances are potentially executed by another thread. 

The **Executors** class contains utility methods to convert from other common forms to Callable classes.

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Callable<V> {
    /**
     * Computes a result, or throws an exception if unable to do so.
     */
    V call() throws Exception;
}
```





The AccessController class is used for access control operations and decisions.
More specifically, the AccessController class is used for three purposes:

1. to decide whether an access to a critical system resource is to be allowed or denied, based on the security policy currently in effect,
2. to mark code as being "privileged", thus affecting subsequent access determinations, and
3. to obtain a "snapshot" of the current calling context so access-control decisions from a different context can be made with respect to the saved context.



### PrivilegedCallable

```java
/**
 * A callable that runs under established access control settings
 */
static final class PrivilegedCallable<T> implements Callable<T> {
    private final Callable<T> task;
    private final AccessControlContext acc;

    PrivilegedCallable(Callable<T> task) {
        this.task = task;
        this.acc = AccessController.getContext();
    }

    public T call() throws Exception {
        try {
            return AccessController.doPrivileged(
                new PrivilegedExceptionAction<T>() {
                    public T run() throws Exception {
                        return task.call();
                    }
                }, acc);
        } catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
            throw e.getException();
        }
    }
}
```



```java
/**
 * A callable that runs under established access control settings and
 * current ClassLoader
 */
static final class PrivilegedCallableUsingCurrentClassLoader<T> implements Callable<T> {
    private final Callable<T> task;
    private final AccessControlContext acc;
    private final ClassLoader ccl;

    PrivilegedCallableUsingCurrentClassLoader(Callable<T> task) {
        SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
        if (sm != null) {
            // Calls to getContextClassLoader from this class
            // never trigger a security check, but we check
            // whether our callers have this permission anyways.
            sm.checkPermission(SecurityConstants.GET_CLASSLOADER_PERMISSION);

            // Whether setContextClassLoader turns out to be necessary
            // or not, we fail fast if permission is not available.
            sm.checkPermission(new RuntimePermission("setContextClassLoader"));
        }
        this.task = task;
        this.acc = AccessController.getContext();
        this.ccl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
    }

    public T call() throws Exception {
        try {
            return AccessController.doPrivileged(
                new PrivilegedExceptionAction<T>() {
                    public T run() throws Exception {
                        Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
                        ClassLoader cl = t.getContextClassLoader();
                        if (ccl == cl) {
                            return task.call();
                        } else {
                            t.setContextClassLoader(ccl);
                            try {
                                return task.call();
                            } finally {
                                t.setContextClassLoader(cl);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }, acc);
        } catch (PrivilegedActionException e) {
            throw e.getException();
        }
    }
}
```



### AccessControlContext

```java
/**
 * This method takes a "snapshot" of the current calling context, which
 * includes the current Thread's inherited AccessControlContext and any
 * limited privilege scope, and places it in an AccessControlContext object.
 * This context may then be checked at a later point, possibly in another thread.
 */
public static AccessControlContext getContext()
{
    AccessControlContext acc = getStackAccessControlContext();
    if (acc == null) {
        // all we had was privileged system code. We don't want
        // to return null though, so we construct a real ACC.
        return new AccessControlContext(null, true);
    } else {
        return acc.optimize();
    }
}

/**
 * Returns the AccessControl context. i.e., it gets
 * the protection domains of all the callers on the stack,
 * starting at the first class with a non-null
 * ProtectionDomain.
 */
private static native AccessControlContext getStackAccessControlContext();
```



```java
/**
 * Performs the specified {@code PrivilegedExceptionAction} with
 * privileges enabled and restricted by the specified
 * {@code AccessControlContext}.  The action is performed with the
 * intersection of the permissions possessed by the caller's
 * protection domain, and those possessed by the domains represented by the
 * specified {@code AccessControlContext}.
 * <p>
 * If the action's {@code run} method throws an <i>unchecked</i>
 * exception, it will propagate through this method.
 * <p>
 * If a security manager is installed and the specified
 * {@code AccessControlContext} was not created by system code and the
 * caller's {@code ProtectionDomain} has not been granted the
 * {@literal "createAccessControlContext"}
 * {@link java.security.SecurityPermission}, then the action is performed
 * with no permissions.
 */
@CallerSensitive
public static native <T> T
    doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction<T> action,
                 AccessControlContext context)
    throws PrivilegedActionException;
```



### RunnableAdapter

```java
/**
 * A callable that runs given task and returns given result
 */
static final class RunnableAdapter<T> implements Callable<T> {
    final Runnable task;
    final T result;
    RunnableAdapter(Runnable task, T result) {
        this.task = task;
        this.result = result;
    }
    public T call() {
        task.run();
        return result;
    }
}
```







### Future 

Example:

```java
interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 class App {
   ExecutorService executor = ...
   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
   void showSearch(String target) throws InterruptedException {
     Callable<String> task = () -> searcher.search(target);
     Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);
     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
     try {
       displayText(future.get()); // use future
     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
   }
 }
```



**Memory consistency effects**: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation happen-before actions following the corresponding Future.get() in another thread.

```java
/**
 * A {@code Future} represents the result of an asynchronous
 * computation.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
 * complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
 * the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
 * {@code get} when the computation has completed, blocking if
 * necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
 * {@code cancel} method.  Additional methods are provided to
 * determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
 * computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
 * If you would like to use a {@code Future} for the sake
 * of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 * declare types of the form {@code Future<?>} and
 * return {@code null} as a result of the underlying task.
 */
public interface Future<V> {

    /**
     * Attempts to cancel execution of this task.  This attempt will
     * fail if the task has already completed, has already been cancelled,
     * or could not be cancelled for some other reason. If successful,
     * and this task has not started when {@code cancel} is called,
     * this task should never run.  If the task has already started,
     * then the {@code mayInterruptIfRunning} parameter determines
     * whether the thread executing this task should be interrupted in
     * an attempt to stop the task.
     *
     * <p>After this method returns, subsequent calls to {@link #isDone} will
     * always return {@code true}.  Subsequent calls to {@link #isCancelled}
     * will always return {@code true} if this method returned {@code true}.
     */
    boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning);

    // Returns {@code true} if this task was cancelled before it completed normally.
    boolean isCancelled();

    /**
     * Returns {@code true} if this task completed.
     *
     * Completion may be due to normal termination, an exception, or
     * cancellation -- in all of these cases, this method will return
     * {@code true}.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if this task completed
     */
    boolean isDone();

    // Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result.
    V get() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException;

    // Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available
    V get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
        throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException;
}
```



### RunnableFuture

```java
/**
 * A {@link Future} that is {@link Runnable}. Successful execution of
 * the {@code run} method causes completion of the {@code Future}
 * and allows access to its results.
 * @see FutureTask
 * @see Executor
 * @since 1.6
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @param <V> The result type returned by this Future's {@code get} method
 */

    /**
     * Sets this Future to the result of its computation
     * unless it has been cancelled.
     */
    void run();
}
```



## FutureTask

The FutureTask class is an implementation of Future that implements Runnable, and so may be executed by an Executor. For example, the above construction with submit could be replaced by:
```java
 FutureTask future = new FutureTask<>(task);
 executor.execute(future);
```



```java
/**
 * A cancellable asynchronous computation.  This class provides a base
 * implementation of {@link Future}, with methods to start and cancel
 * a computation, query to see if the computation is complete, and
 * retrieve the result of the computation.  The result can only be
 * retrieved when the computation has completed; the {@code get}
 * methods will block if the computation has not yet completed.  Once
 * the computation has completed, the computation cannot be restarted
 * or cancelled (unless the computation is invoked using
 * {@link #runAndReset}).
 *
 * <p>A {@code FutureTask} can be used to wrap a {@link Callable} or
 * {@link Runnable} object.  Because {@code FutureTask} implements
 * {@code Runnable}, a {@code FutureTask} can be submitted to an
 * {@link Executor} for execution.
 *
 * <p>In addition to serving as a standalone class, this class provides
 * {@code protected} functionality that may be useful when creating
 * customized task classes.

     * class that relied on AbstractQueuedSynchronizer, mainly to
     * avoid surprising users about retaining interrupt status during
     * cancellation races. Sync control in the current design relies
     * on a "state" field updated via CAS to track completion, along
     * with a simple Treiber stack to hold waiting threads.
     *
     * Style note: As usual, we bypass overhead of using
     * AtomicXFieldUpdaters and instead directly use Unsafe intrinsics.
