## Introduction

[GNU](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html) is an operating system that is free softwareâ€”that is, it respects users' freedom. 
The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties.
The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.
