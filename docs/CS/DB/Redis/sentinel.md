## Introduction

Sentinels by default run **listening for connections to TCP port 26379**, so for Sentinels to work, port 26379 of your servers **must be open** to receive connections from the IP addresses of the other Sentinel instances.
Otherwise Sentinels can't talk and can't agree about what to do, so failover will never be performed.

In practical terms this means during failures **Sentinel never starts a failover if the majority of Sentinel processes are unable to talk** (aka no failover in the minority partition).

```
down-after-milliseconds
```

1. If the replica priority is set to 0, the replica is never promoted to master.
2. Replicas with a *lower* priority number are preferred by Sentinel.

```
slave-priority
```

max

```
slave_repl_offset
```

min id

`__sentinel__:hello`

## Testing the failover

At this point our toy Sentinel deployment is ready to be tested. We can just kill our master and check if the configuration changes. To do so we can just do:

```
redis-cli -p 6379 DEBUG sleep 30
```

This command will make our master no longer reachable, sleeping for 30 seconds. It basically simulates a master hanging for some reason.

If you check the Sentinel logs, you should be able to see a lot of action:

1. Each Sentinel detects the master is down with an `+sdown` event.
2. This event is later escalated to `+odown`, which means that multiple Sentinels agree about the fact the master is not reachable.
3. Sentinels vote a Sentinel that will start the first failover attempt.
4. The failover happens.

If you ask again what is the current master address for `mymaster`, eventually we should get a different reply this time:

```
127.0.0.1:5000> SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster
1) "127.0.0.1"
2) "6380"
```

So far so good... At this point you may jump to create your Sentinel deployment or can read more to understand all the Sentinel commands and internals.

    *leader_epoch = master->leader_epoch;
    return master->leader ? sdsnew(master->leader) : NULL;
}
```

### handleDict

Perform scheduled operations for all the instances in the dictionary.
Recursively call the function against dictionaries of slaves.

```c
void sentinelHandleDictOfRedisInstances(dict *instances) {
    dictIterator *di;
    dictEntry *de;
    sentinelRedisInstance *switch_to_promoted = NULL;

    /* There are a number of things we need to perform against every master. */
    di = dictGetIterator(instances);
    while((de = dictNext(di)) != NULL) {
        sentinelRedisInstance *ri = dictGetVal(de);

        sentinelHandleRedisInstance(ri);
        if (ri->flags & SRI_MASTER) {
            sentinelHandleDictOfRedisInstances(ri->slaves);
            sentinelHandleDictOfRedisInstances(ri->sentinels);
            if (ri->failover_state == SENTINEL_FAILOVER_STATE_UPDATE_CONFIG) {
                switch_to_promoted = ri;
            }
        }
    }
    if (switch_to_promoted)
        sentinelFailoverSwitchToPromotedSlave(switch_to_promoted);
    dictReleaseIterator(di);
}
```

## handle

This is the "main" our Sentinel, being sentinel completely non blocking in design. The function is called every second.

Perform scheduled operations for the specified Redis instance.

```c
void sentinelHandleRedisInstance(sentinelRedisInstance *ri) {
    /* ========== MONITORING HALF ============ */
    /* Every kind of instance */
    sentinelReconnectInstance(ri);
    sentinelSendPeriodicCommands(ri);

    /* ============== ACTING HALF ============= */
    /* We don't proceed with the acting half if we are in TILT mode.
     * TILT happens when we find something odd with the time, like a
     * sudden change in the clock. */
    if (sentinel.tilt) {
        if (mstime()-sentinel.tilt_start_time < SENTINEL_TILT_PERIOD) return;
        sentinel.tilt = 0;
        sentinelEvent(LL_WARNING,"-tilt",NULL,"#tilt mode exited");
    }

    sentinelCheckSubjectivelyDown(ri);

    /* Masters and slaves */
    if (ri->flags & (SRI_MASTER|SRI_SLAVE)) {
        /* Nothing so far. */
    }

    /* Only masters */
    if (ri->flags & SRI_MASTER) {
        sentinelCheckObjectivelyDown(ri);

```

failover

```c
        if (sentinelStartFailoverIfNeeded(ri))
            sentinelAskMasterStateToOtherSentinels(ri,SENTINEL_ASK_FORCED);
        sentinelFailoverStateMachine(ri);
        sentinelAskMasterStateToOtherSentinels(ri,SENTINEL_NO_FLAGS);
    }
}
```

#### sentinelStartFailoverIfNeeded

This function checks if there are the conditions to start the failover, that is:

1. Master must be in ODOWN condition.
2. No failover already in progress.
3. No failover already attempted recently.

We still don't know if we'll win the election so it is possible that we start the failover but that we'll not be able to act.

Return non-zero if a failover was started.

```c
int sentinelStartFailoverIfNeeded(sentinelRedisInstance *master) {
    /* We can't failover if the master is not in O_DOWN state. */
    if (!(master->flags & SRI_O_DOWN)) return 0;

    /* Failover already in progress? */
    if (master->flags & SRI_FAILOVER_IN_PROGRESS) return 0;

    /* Last failover attempt started too little time ago? */
    if (mstime() - master->failover_start_time <
        master->failover_timeout*2)
    {
        if (master->failover_delay_logged != master->failover_start_time) {
            time_t clock = (master->failover_start_time +
                            master->failover_timeout*2) / 1000;
            char ctimebuf[26];

            ctime_r(&clock,ctimebuf);
            ctimebuf[24] = '\0'; /* Remove newline. */
            master->failover_delay_logged = master->failover_start_time;
            serverLog(LL_WARNING,
                "Next failover delay: I will not start a failover before %s",
                ctimebuf);
        }
        return 0;
    }

    sentinelStartFailover(master);
    return 1;
}
```

If we think the master is down, we start sending SENTINEL IS-MASTER-DOWN-BY-ADDR requests to other sentinels in order to get the replies that allow to reach the quorum needed to mark the master in ODOWN state and trigger a failover.

```c
#define SENTINEL_ASK_FORCED (1<<0)
void sentinelAskMasterStateToOtherSentinels(sentinelRedisInstance *master, int flags) {
    dictIterator *di;
    dictEntry *de;

    di = dictGetIterator(master->sentinels);
    while((de = dictNext(di)) != NULL) {
        sentinelRedisInstance *ri = dictGetVal(de);
        mstime_t elapsed = mstime() - ri->last_master_down_reply_time;
        char port[32];
        int retval;

        /* If the master state from other sentinel is too old, we clear it. */
        if (elapsed > SENTINEL_ASK_PERIOD*5) {
            ri->flags &= ~SRI_MASTER_DOWN;
            sdsfree(ri->leader);
            ri->leader = NULL;
        }

        /* Only ask if master is down to other sentinels if:
         *
         * 1) We believe it is down, or there is a failover in progress.
         * 2) Sentinel is connected.
         * 3) We did not receive the info within SENTINEL_ASK_PERIOD ms. */
        if ((master->flags & SRI_S_DOWN) == 0) continue;
        if (ri->link->disconnected) continue;
        if (!(flags & SENTINEL_ASK_FORCED) &&
            mstime() - ri->last_master_down_reply_time < SENTINEL_ASK_PERIOD)
            continue;

        /* Ask */
        ll2string(port,sizeof(port),master->addr->port);
        retval = redisAsyncCommand(ri->link->cc,
                    sentinelReceiveIsMasterDownReply, ri,
                    "%s is-master-down-by-addr %s %s %llu %s",
                    sentinelInstanceMapCommand(ri,"SENTINEL"),
                    announceSentinelAddr(master->addr), port,
                    sentinel.current_epoch,
                    (master->failover_state > SENTINEL_FAILOVER_STATE_NONE) ?
                    sentinel.myid : "*");
        if (retval == C_OK) ri->link->pending_commands++;
    }
    dictReleaseIterator(di);
}
```

#### voteLeader

Vote for the sentinel with 'req_runid' or return the old vote if already voted for the specified 'req_epoch' or one greater.
If a vote is not available returns NULL, otherwise return the Sentinel runid and populate the leader_epoch with the epoch of the vote.

```c
char *sentinelVoteLeader(sentinelRedisInstance *master, uint64_t req_epoch, char *req_runid, uint64_t *leader_epoch) {
    if (req_epoch > sentinel.current_epoch) {
        sentinel.current_epoch = req_epoch;
        sentinelFlushConfig();
        sentinelEvent(LL_WARNING,"+new-epoch",master,"%llu",
            (unsigned long long) sentinel.current_epoch);
    }

    if (master->leader_epoch < req_epoch && sentinel.current_epoch <= req_epoch)
    {
        sdsfree(master->leader);
        master->leader = sdsnew(req_runid);
        master->leader_epoch = sentinel.current_epoch;
        sentinelFlushConfig();
        sentinelEvent(LL_WARNING,"+vote-for-leader",master,"%s %llu",
            master->leader, (unsigned long long) master->leader_epoch);
        /* If we did not voted for ourselves, set the master failover start
         * time to now, in order to force a delay before we can start a
         * failover for the same master. */
        if (strcasecmp(master->leader,sentinel.myid))
            master->failover_start_time = mstime()+rand()%SENTINEL_MAX_DESYNC;
    }

    *leader_epoch = master->leader_epoch;
    return master->leader ? sdsnew(master->leader) : NULL;
}
```

## Failover

### State Machine

```c

void sentinelFailoverStateMachine(sentinelRedisInstance *ri) {
    serverAssert(ri->flags & SRI_MASTER);

    if (!(ri->flags & SRI_FAILOVER_IN_PROGRESS)) return;

    switch(ri->failover_state) {

### Failover-Start

```c

### Recon Next Slave

Send SLAVE OF <new master address> to all the remaining slaves that still don't appear to have the configuration updated.
