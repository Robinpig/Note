## Introduction



All the server configuration and in general all the shared state is
defined in a global structure called `server`, of type `struct redisServer`.
A few important fields in this structure are:

* `server.db` is an array of Redis databases, where data is stored.
* `server.commands` is the command table.
* `server.clients` is a linked list of clients connected to the server.
* `server.master` is a special client, the master, if the instance is a replica.
