## Introduction


* `createClient()` allocates and initializes a new client.
* the `addReply*()` family of functions are used by command implementations in order to append data to the client structure, that will be transmitted to the client as a reply for a given command executed.
* `writeToClient()` transmits the data pending in the output buffers to the client and is called by the *writable event handler* `sendReplyToClient()`.
* `readQueryFromClient()` is the *readable event handler* and accumulates data read from the client into the query buffer.
* `processInputBuffer()` is the entry point in order to parse the client query buffer according to the Redis protocol. Once commands are ready to be processed, it calls `processCommand()` which is defined inside `server.c` in order to actually execute the command.
* `freeClient()` deallocates, disconnects and removes a client.
