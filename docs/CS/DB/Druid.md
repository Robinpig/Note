## Introduction

[Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/) is a real-time analytics database designed for fast slice-and-dice analytics ("[OLAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing)" queries) on large data sets. Most often, Druid powers use cases where real-time ingestion, fast query performance, and high uptime are important.
