## Introduction

[LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.


## Data Types

Keys and values are arbitrary byte arrays. The keys are ordered within the key value store according to a user-specified comparator function.
