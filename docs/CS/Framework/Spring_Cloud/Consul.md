## Introduction

Consul is a service networking solution that enables teams to manage secure network connectivity between services and across multi-cloud environments and runtimes. 
Consul offers service discovery, identity-based authorization, L7 traffic management, and service-to-service encryption.

```shell
consul agent -dev
```

## Architecture
Consul provides a control plane that enables you to register, access, and secure services deployed across your network. 
The control plane is the part of the network infrastructure that maintains a central registry to track services and their respective IP addresses.

When using Consul’s service mesh capabilities, Consul dynamically configures sidecar and gateway proxies in the request path, which enables you to authorize service-to-service connections,
route requests to healthy service instances, and enforce mTLS encryption without modifying your service’s code. 
This ensures that communication remains performant and reliable.
