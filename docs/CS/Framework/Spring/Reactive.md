# Reactive

## Introduction

*Systems built as Reactive Systems are more flexible, loosely-coupled and [scalable](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#Scalability).
This makes them easier to develop and amenable to change.
They are significantly more tolerant of failure and when [failure](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#Failure) does occur they meet it with elegance rather than disaster.
Reactive Systems are highly responsive, giving [users](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/glossary#User) effective interactive feedback.*

[The Reactive Manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)

Reactive Systems are:

1. Responsive
2. Resilient
3. Elastic
4. Message Driven
