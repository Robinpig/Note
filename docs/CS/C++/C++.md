## Introduction


C++ blends the C language with support for object-oriented programming and for generic programming.


## Basic concepts


Resource Acquisition Is Initialization or RAII, is a C++ programming technique which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use 
(allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) 
to the lifetime of an object.
