## Introduction

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of [containerized](/docs/CS/Container/Container.md) applications.

Kubernetes has the following characteristics:

- It is made of a manager and a set of nodes
- It has a scheduler to place containers in a cluster
- It has an API server and a persistence layer with etcd
- It has a controller to reconcile states
- It is deployed on VMs or bare-metal machines, in public clouds, or on-premise
- It is written in Go

Kubernetes is a mature and feature-rich solution for managing containerized applications. It is not the only container orchestrator, and there are four others:

- Docker Swarm
- Apache Mesos
- Nomad from HashiCorp
- Rancher

At a high level, there is nothing different between Kubernetes and other clustering systems. 
A central manager exposes an API, a scheduler places the workloads on a set of nodes, and the state of the cluster is stored in a persistent layer.
In Kubernetes, however, the persistence layer is implemented with etcd instead of Zookeeper for Mesos.

## Installing K8s



```shell
swapoff -a

# Add vm.swappiness = 0
sudo vim /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
```


### Installing kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl

You will install these packages on all of your machines:

- kubeadm: the command to bootstrap the cluster.
- kubelet: the component that runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.
- kubectl: the command line util to talk to your cluster.

##### **CentOS**

```shell
# Set SELinux in permissive mode (effectively disabling it)
sudo setenforce 0
sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=enforcing$/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config

# This overwrites any existing configuration in /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64/

repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://mirrors.aliyun.com/kubernetes/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg

EOF

# Only for CentOS7
cat <<EOF >  /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
EOF
sysctl --system

sudo yum install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes
sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet
```

##### **Ubuntu**

```shell
sudo apt-get update
# apt-transport-https may be a dummy package; if so, you can skip that package
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

# This overwrites any existing configuration in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

Master

Kubernetes runs your workload by placing containers into Pods to run on Nodes. 
A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster.
Each node is managed by the control plane and contains the services necessary to run Pods.

Typically you have several nodes in a cluster; in a learning or resource-limited environment, you might have only one node.

The components on a node include the kubelet, a container runtime, and the kube-proxy.

Kubernetes supports container runtimes such as containerd, CRI-O, and any other implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).

## CRI-O

CRI-O is an implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface) to enable using OCI (Open Container Initiative) compatible runtimes.
It is a lightweight alternative to using [Docker](/docs/CS/Container/Docker.md) as the runtime for kubernetes. 
It allows Kubernetes to use any OCI-compliant runtime as the container runtime for running pods. 
Today it supports runc and Kata Containers as the container runtimes but any OCI-conformant runtime can be plugged in principle.

CRI-O supports OCI container images and can pull from any container registry. 
It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker, Moby or rkt as the runtime for Kubernetes.
