## Introduction

[LLDB]（https://lldb.llvm.org/index.html）is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It is built as a set of reusable components which highly leverage existing libraries in the larger LLVM Project, such as the Clang expression parser and LLVM disassembler.

LLDB is the default debugger in Xcode on macOS and supports debugging C, Objective-C and C++ on the desktop and iOS devices and simulator

For users already familiar with [GDB](/docs/CS/C/GDB.md) there is a cheat sheet listing common tasks and their LLDB equivalent in the [GDB to LLDB command map](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html).
