## Introduction


The **Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks** better known as **RAID**, a technique to use multiple disks in concert to build a faster, bigger, and more reliable disk system.



- RAID Level 0: Striping
- RAID Level 1: Mirroring
- RAID Level 4: Saving Space With Parity
- RAID Level 5: Rotating Parity



RAID transforms a number of independent disks into a large, more capacious, and more reliable single entity; importantly, it does so transparently, and thus hardware and software above is relatively oblivious to the change.

There are many possible RAID levels to choose from, and the exact RAID level to use depends heavily on what is important to the end-user.
For example, mirrored RAID is simple, reliable, and generally provides good performance but at a high capacity cost. 
RAID-5, in contrast, is reliable and better from a capacity standpoint, but performs quite poorly when there are small writes in the workload.
