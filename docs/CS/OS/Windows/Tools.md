## Introduction



## Compiler

Mingw-w64 is a collection of header files, import libraries, libraries and tools that, when combined with a compiler toolchain, such as GCC or LLVM, provides a complete development environment for building native Windows applications and libraries.
Mingw-w64 is an advancement of the original mingw.org project, which was created to support the GCC compiler on Windows systems. It was forked in 2007 in order to provide 64-bit support and newer APIs. It has since then gained wide use and distribution.



Cygwin is:
- a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.
- a DLL (cygwin1.dll) which provides substantial POSIX API functionality.
