## Introduction

A [computer network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network) is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. 
The computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other. 
These interconnections are made up of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, 
and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.
