## Introduction

There are three primary properties of information, whether in a computer network or not, that may be desirable from an information security point of view: 
confidentiality, integrity, and availability (the CIA triad), summarized here:
- Confidentiality means that information is made known only to its intended users (which could include processing systems).
- Integrity means that information has not been modified in an unauthorized way before it is delivered.
- Availability means that information is available when needed.

These are core properties of information, yet there are other properties we may also desire, including authentication, nonrepudiation, and auditability. 
Authentication means that a particular identified party or principal is not impersonating another principal. 
Nonrepudiation means that if some action is performed by a principal (e.g., agreeing to the terms of a contract), this fact can be proven later (i.e., cannot successfully be denied). 
Auditability means that some sort of trustworthy log or accounting describing how information has been used is available. 
Such logs are often important for forensic (i.e., legal and prosecuritorial) purposes.
