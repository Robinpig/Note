## Introduction

Kafka Connect is a part of Apache Kafka and provides a scalable and reliable way to move data between Kafka and other datastores.
It provides APIs and a runtime to develop and run connector pluginsâ€”libraries that Kafka Connect executes and which are responsible for moving the data. 
Kafka Connect runs as a cluster of `worker processes`.
