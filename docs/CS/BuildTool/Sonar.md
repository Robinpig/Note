The Sonar solution performs checks at every stage of the development process:

- SonarLint provides immediate feedback in your IDE as you write code so you can find and fix issues before a commit.
- SonarQube’s PR analysis fits into your CI/CD workflows with SonarQube’s PR analysis and use of quality gates.
- Quality gates keep code with issues from being released to production, a key tool in helping you incorporate the Clean as You Code methodology.
- The Clean as You Code approach helps you focus on submitting new, clean code for production, knowing that your existing code will be improved over time.
