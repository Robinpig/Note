## Introduction


Developing computer software can be a complicated process, and in the last 25 years, researchers have identified numerous distinct activities that go into software development. 
They include
- Problem definition
- Requirements development
- Construction planning
- Software architecture, or high-level design
- Detailed design
- Coding and debugging
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- IntegrationSystem testing
- Corrective maintenance


Construction is mostly coding and debugging but also involves detailed design, construction planning, unit testing, integration, integration testing, and other activities.


Here are some of the specific tasks involved in construction:
- Verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that construction can proceed successfully
- Determining how your code will be tested
- Designing and writing classes and routines
- Creating and naming variables and named constants
- Selecting control structures and organizing blocks of statements
- Unit testing, integration testing, and debugging your own code
- Reviewing other team members' low-level designs and code and having them review yours
- Polishing code by carefully formatting and commenting it
- Integrating software components that were created separately
- Tuning code to make it faster and use fewer resources
