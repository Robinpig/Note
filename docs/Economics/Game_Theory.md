## Nash Equilibrium

Nash Equilibrium is a game theory concept that determines the optimal solution in a non-cooperative game in which each player lacks any incentive to change his/her initial strategy. 
Under the Nash equilibrium, a player does not gain anything from deviating from their initially chosen strategy, assuming the other players also keep their strategies unchanged. 
A game may have multiple Nash equilibria or none at all.

The prisoners' dilemma is a common game theory example and one that adequately showcases the effect of the Nash equilibrium.

- In the Nash equilibrium, each player's strategy is optimal when considering the decisions of other players. Every player wins because everyone gets the outcome they desire.
- The Nash equilibrium does not always mean that the most optimal strategy is chosen.
