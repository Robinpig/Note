## Introduction


The pigeonhole principle is the following:

If m objects are placed into n bins, where m > n, then some bin contains at least two objects.


- To use the pigeonhole principle:
 - Find the m objects to distribute.
 - Find the n < m buckets into which to distribute them.
 - Conclude by the pigeonhole principle that there must be two objects in some bucket.
- The details of how to proceeds from there are specific to the particular proof you're doing.
