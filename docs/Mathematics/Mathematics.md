## Introduction

## Primary Math

Primary math, also referred to as elementary math or early math, is a category of mathematics that covers topics that are typically learned in early education.
The topics learned in primary math, including tools, concepts, etc., provide a foundation for learning mathematics.
They include topics such as numbers, counting, arithmetic, measurement, basic data visualization and analysis, and more.

Below are some of the key topics in primary math.

### Exponents

```tex
\begin{aligned}

X^AX^B  &= X^{A+B} \\
\frac{X^A}{X^B} &=X^{A-B} \\
(X^A)^B&=X^{AB} \\
X^N+X^N&=X{2N} \\
2^N+2^N&=2^{N+1}

\end{aligned}
```

### Logarithms

In computer science, all logarithms are to base 2 unless specified otherwise.

DEFINITION: x^a = b if and only if $ \log_x{b} = a $

```tex
\begin{aligned}

\log_A({B}) &=\frac{\log_C{A}}{\log_B{A}}; \space C>0 \\

\log{AB} &=\log{A}+\log{B}

\end{aligned}
```

### Series

```tex
\sum_{i=0}^{N}2^i=2^{N+1}-1
```

### Modular Arithmetic

## 韦达定理

代数基本定理：几次方程有几个根

求一元二次方程

$$
ax^2+bx+c=0 (a\neq 0)
$$

两根

$$
x_1+x_2=-{b\over a}
$$

And

$$
x_1x_2={c\over a}
$$

so

$$
x_{1,2}={-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a }
$$

## Pure Mathematics

## Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which arithmetic is extended to deal with unknown numbers or relationships using letters and other symbols.
It is a broad branch that is used to some degree in almost all other areas of mathematics.
As such, for those who seek to pursue virtually any higher study of mathematics, it is important to have a strong grasp of algebra.

The letters or symbols used in algebra are called variables.

Elementary algebra includes concepts such as variables and algebraic notation,
simplifying expressions, equations, properties of equality and inequality, substitution, solving algebraic equations, and more.
These form the foundation that will eventually allow us to approach more difficult algebraic and mathematical topics.

## Geometry

Geometry is a branch of mathematics that includes the study of shape, size, and other properties of figures.
It is one of the oldest branches of mathematics and may have been used even in prehistoric times.

### Plane Geometry

A point indicates a location in space. It has no dimension and is represented by a dot. Points are typically labeled with capital letters.

A line has one dimension, its length, and is represented with a line containing arrows indicating it extends in either direction indefinitely.
Two non-overlapping points determine a unique line and we can name the line with those two points or any other two points on the line.

A plane has two dimensions, length and width, and forms a flat surface (such as a piece of notebook paper) extending in both directions indefinitely.
A plane can be named by three noncollinear points or by a letter.

### Solid Geometry

Solid geometry is the branch of geometry.
The solids are polyhedra (plural for polyhedron) or non-polyhedra.

A polyhedron is a solid whose faces are polygons.

A non-polyhedron is a solid that has all or partly curved surfaces.

There are numerous branches of geometry that are classified based on various criteria such as the methods of study,
the types of objects studied, and more.

**Analytic Geometry**

Analytic geometry is the study of plane and solid geometry that uses Algebra and incorporates the two-dimensional coordinate plane or three-dimensional coordinate plane.
It is sometimes referred to as coordinate geometry for this reason.

Since analytic geometry uses Algebra and the coordinate planes for geometric figures,
it tends to be more numerical in nature, and thus has proven to be an important branch of mathematics used by engineers and physicists.

**Euclidean Geometry**

Euclidean geometry is the study of plane and solid geometry which uses axioms,
postulates, and deductive reasoning to prove theorems about geometric concepts.

**Non-Euclidean Geometry**

Non-Euclidean geometry typically uses most of the ideas of Euclidean geometry but uses a different version of Euclid's parallel postulate.
In Euclidean geometry two parallel lines never intersect.
In Non-Euclidean geometry, parallel lines can intersect depending on which type of geometry is chosen.
There are two basic types: Spherical and Hyperbolic Non-Euclidean geometries.

Think of folding a plane in Euclidean geometry onto a sphere or a hyperboloid (a three-dimensional hyperbola).
The lines are bent and circular or elliptical in spherical geometry, and parabolic or hyperbolic in hyperbolic geometry.




## Calculus

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that is the study of change.
We use calculus to help explain the physical world around us.
Disciplines such as physics, statistics, economics, and medicine, 
use calculus to not only explain the problems and issues that confront them,
but also to construct models that can be used to predict future events or to describe past events.

The two main branches of calculus are differential calculus and integral calculus. 
At its base, differential calculus deals with rates of change and considers the slope of a function at a point, 
while integral calculus considers the area under and between the curves of a function.

In practice, calculus involves the thorough study of limits, 
as an understanding of limits is necessary in order to tackle topics such as continuity, derivatives, integrals, series, and more.

### Derivative
The derivative of a function is the rate of change of the function's output relative to its input value. 
Given y = f(x), the derivative of f(x), denoted f'(x) (or df(x)/dx), is defined by the following limit:
```tex
f'(x) = 
```
