## Introduction

The two main branches of calculus are differential calculus and integral calculus.
At its base, differential calculus deals with rates of change and considers the slope of a function at a point,
while integral calculus considers the area under and between the curves of a function.

In practice, calculus involves the thorough study of limits,
as an understanding of limits is necessary in order to tackle topics such as continuity, derivatives, integrals, series, and more.

### Derivative

Derivatives enable us to determine the slope of a curve at any specific point.
The derivative of a function is the rate of change of the function's output relative to its input value.
Given y = f(x), the derivative of f(x), denoted f'(x) (or df(x)/dx), is defined by the following limit:

f'(x) = 
```
