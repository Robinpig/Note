## Distributed Systems

A [distributed system](/docs/CS/Distributed/Distributed_Systems.md) is one in which components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages.
This definition leads to the following especially significant characteristics of distributed systems: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock and independent failures of components.

## C

## C++

[C++](/docs/CS/C++/C++.md) blends the C language with support for object-oriented programming and for generic programming.
